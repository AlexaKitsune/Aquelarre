## Assets
This project has 10 images (not included in the repository), which correspond to .png files of the silhouette of an animal in a specific color, with a transparent background.  

These images will be located inside `src/assets/animal_pillars/`, and will contain the images that should be named as follows:  

`00fff0_shilouette_cat.png`  
`00fff0_shilouette_cow.png`  
`00fff0_shilouette_doe.png`  
`00fff0_shilouette_fox.png`  
`00fff0_shilouette_hyn.png`  
They should be images of a cat, cow, deer, fox and hyena respectively, all in blue (`#00FFF0`) and with a transparent background.

`orange_shilouette_cat.png`  
`orange_shilouette_cow.png`  
`orange_shilouette_doe.png`  
`orange_shilouette_fox.png`  
`orange_shilouette_hyn.png`  
They should be images of a cat, cow, deer, fox and hyena respectively, all orange (`#FFA500`) and transparent background.

Each image should only contain one color (the one indicated) and transparency.
